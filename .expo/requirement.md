## **Dynamic Wallpaper System for Carbonetrix**

### **1. Project Overview**
- **Objective**: Develop a dynamic wallpaper system for Carbonetrix that displays 30 unique home/lock screen wallpapers. These wallpapers will change when the user turns the screen on or off, accompanied by motivational texts and the Carbonetrix logo.
- **Target Audience**: Built environment professionals, sustainability advocates, and Carbonetrix users.
- **Platform**: Android (using HiOS Launcher or custom launcher).
- **Key Features**:
  - 30 dynamic wallpapers with motivational texts and the Carbonetrix logo.
  - Seamless transitions between wallpapers on screen-on/screen-off events.
  - Customizable themes and animations.
  - Lightweight and optimized for performance.

---

### **2. Technical Workflow**
#### **a. Development Tools**
- **Programming Language**: Kotlin (preferred for Android development).
- **APIs**:
  - **Live Wallpaper API**: For dynamic wallpapers.
  - **BroadcastReceiver**: To detect screen-on/screen-off events.
  - **Canvas/OpenGL ES**: For rendering animations.
- **Libraries**:
  - **Lottie**: For lightweight animations.
  - **Glide/Picasso**: For efficient image loading.
  - **Room Database**: For storing user preferences.

#### **b. Workflow**
1. **Wallpaper Engine**:
   - Create a `WallpaperService` to handle dynamic wallpapers.
   - Use `SurfaceView` or `Canvas` to render wallpapers and animations.
   - Implement a `BroadcastReceiver` to detect screen-on/screen-off events.

2. **Wallpaper Transition Logic**:
   - Store 30 wallpapers in the appâ€™s `res/drawable` folder or download them dynamically.
   - Use a `Random` or `Sequential` algorithm to cycle through wallpapers.
   - Trigger transitions on screen events.

3. **Motivational Texts and Logo**:
   - Overlay text and the Carbonetrix logo on wallpapers using `Canvas.drawText()` and `Canvas.drawBitmap()`.
   - Store texts in a `strings.xml` file or a local database.

4. **Customization**:
   - Allow users to select wallpapers or enable random cycling.
   - Provide options to adjust text size, font, and color.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Compress wallpapers to reduce memory usage.
   - Use background threads for loading resources.

---

### **3. Design Considerations**
- **Wallpaper Themes**:
  - Use nature-inspired imagery (e.g., forests, renewable energy, green buildings).
  - Incorporate Carbonetrix branding (colors, logos).
- **Text Overlay**:
  - Use clean, readable fonts.
  - Ensure text contrasts well with the wallpaper background.
- **Logo Placement**:
  - Position the logo in a non-intrusive area (e.g., bottom-right corner, top-center).
  - Use semi-transparent versions for a subtle effect.
- **Animations**:
  - Subtle transitions (e.g., fade-in/fade-out, sliding effects).
  - Avoid heavy animations to ensure smooth performance.

### **4. Motivational Texts for Wallpapers**
Here are **30 motivational texts** that align with Carbonetrixâ€™s mission. Each text will be displayed on a unique wallpaper:

1. **"Decarbonize today for a sustainable tomorrow."**
2. **"Every project counts. Build green, build smart."**
3. **"Empowering the built environment to achieve net zero."**
4. **"Sustainability starts with a single step. Take yours now."**
5. **"Reduce emissions, enhance biodiversity, and thrive."**
6. **"The future is green. Letâ€™s build it together."**
7. **"Carbon intelligence for a cleaner planet."**
8. **"Small changes, big impact. Decarbonize your projects."**
9. **"Innovate. Collaborate. Decarbonize."**
10. **"Your projects can change the world. Make them sustainable."**
11. **"Track, reduce, and achieve your carbon goals."**
12. **"Sustainability is not a choice; itâ€™s a responsibility."**
13. **"Build with purpose. Build for the planet."**
14. **"Together, we can solve the carbon crisis."**
15. **"Green buildings, brighter futures."**
16. **"Decarbonization made simple. Start today."**
17. **"Empowering you to build a net-zero future."**
18. **"Sustainability is the foundation of progress."**
19. **"Turn data into action. Decarbonize smarter."**
20. **"The built environmentâ€™s carbon solution starts here."**
21. **"Innovate sustainably. Lead responsibly."**
22. **"Your projects, your legacy. Make them green."**
23. **"Sustainability is the blueprint for tomorrow."**
24. **"Decarbonize with confidence. Weâ€™ve got your back."**
25. **"Every decision matters. Choose sustainability."**
26. **"Build better. Build greener. Build with Carbonetrix."**
27. **"The road to net zero starts with you."**
28. **"Sustainability is the ultimate innovation."**
29. **"Transform your projects. Transform the planet."**
30. **"Join the movement. Decarbonize the built environment."**

### **6. Example Code Snippets**
#### **a. WallpaperService**
```kotlin
class CarbonetrixWallpaperService : WallpaperService() {
    override fun onCreateEngine(): Engine {
        return CarbonetrixWallpaperEngine()
    }

    inner class CarbonetrixWallpaperEngine : WallpaperService.Engine() {
        private val wallpapers = listOf(
            R.drawable.wallpaper_1,
            R.drawable.wallpaper_2,
            // Add all 30 wallpapers here
        )
        private var currentWallpaperIndex = 0

        override fun onVisibilityChanged(visible: Boolean) {
            if (visible) {
                // Change wallpaper on screen-on
                currentWallpaperIndex = (currentWallpaperIndex + 1) % wallpapers.size
                val wallpaperRes = wallpapers[currentWallpaperIndex]
                // Load and display the wallpaper
                val wallpaper = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(resources, wallpaperRes)
                val canvas = surfaceHolder.lockCanvas()
                canvas?.let {
                    drawWallpaper(canvas, wallpaper)
                    surfaceHolder.unlockCanvasAndPost(canvas)
                }
            }
        }

        private fun drawWallpaper(canvas: Canvas, wallpaper: Bitmap) {
            // Draw wallpaper
            canvas.drawBitmap(wallpaper, 0f, 0f, null)

            // Draw logo
            val logo = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(resources, R.drawable.carbonetrix_logo)
            canvas.drawBitmap(logo, xPosition, yPosition, null)

            // Draw motivational text
            val textPaint = Paint().apply {
                color = Color.WHITE
                textSize = 48f
                typeface = Typeface.create(Typeface.DEFAULT, Typeface.BOLD)
            }
            canvas.drawText("Decarbonize today for a sustainable tomorrow.", xTextPosition, yTextPosition, textPaint)
        }
    }
}
```

#### **b. BroadcastReceiver for Screen Events**
```kotlin
class ScreenReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        when (intent.action) {
            Intent.ACTION_SCREEN_ON -> {
                // Trigger screen-on animation
            }
            Intent.ACTION_SCREEN_OFF -> {
                // Trigger screen-off animation
            }
        }
    }
